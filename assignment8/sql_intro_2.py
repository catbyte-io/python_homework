# Task 5: Read Data into a DataFrame

# While still within the python_homework/assignment8 directory, create a program, sql_intro_2.py.
# Read data into a DataFrame, as described in the lesson. The SQL statement should retrieve the line_item_id, quantity, product_id, product_name, and price from a JOIN of the line_items table and the product table. Hint: Your ON statement would be ON line_items.product_id = products.product_id.
# Print the first 5 lines of the resulting DataFrame. Run the program to make sure this much works.
# Add a column to the DataFrame called "total". This is the quantity times the price. (This is easy: df['total'] = df['quantity'] * df['price'].) Print out the first 5 lines of the DataFrame to make sure this works.
# Add groupby() code to group by the product_id. Use an agg() method that specifies 'count' for the line_item_id column, 'sum' for the total column, and 'first' for the 'product_name'. Print out the first 5 lines of the resulting DataFrame. Run the program to see if it is correct so far.
# Sort the DataFrame by the product_name column.
# Add code to write this DataFrame to a file order_summary.csv, which should be written in the assignment8 directory. Verify that this file is correct.
